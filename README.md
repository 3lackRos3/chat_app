## TalkBot
Twilio Session Managment System.

##Usage
1. Generate and api_key for your application
2. While creating orders send in api_key as `token` in the  header to authenticate your application
3. The order should be in json format in the header file

    `{ 
      "user":{"uid_caller":"uniq_caller_id","uid_receiver":"uniq_receiver_id"},
      "meeting":{"order_id":"9","duration":"601", "start_at":"31-12-2014 21:30"},
      "caller":{"name":"name_of_caller","number":"123789"},
      "receiver":{"name":"name_of_number","number":"123456"}
    }`

| uniq_caller_id   | unique id to represent that caller(user id) eg: `u29if`  |
| uniq_receiver_id | unique id to represent that receiver(user id)            |
| order_id         | order/event/session id as stored in your application     |
| duration         | duration of that order/event/session                     |
| name_of_caller   | name of the caller(user)                                 |
| nubmber          | number of the caller                                     |
| name_of_receiver | name of the receiver(user)                               |
| nubmber          | number of the receiver                                   |

4. In response to the creating the user and order we will send back json data which contains encrypted_caller_id and encrypted_receiver_id in json format

    `{
      "meeting_id":5,
      "encrypted_caller_id":"BAhJIggxMjMGOgZFVA==--45a45db915efc4dd9e79e15c6d7cc54cca9be868",
      "encrypted_receiver_id":"BAhJIgg1NjcGOgZFVA==--0f77e1ef6757389e81669f59ece1ae259832436d"
    }`

5. Store those data in your application.
6. Log in the user into TalkBot by POSTing the encrypted_caller/receiver_id as follows
    
    `http://localhost:3000/sessions?acc_tok=BAhJIggxMjMGOgZFVA==--45a45db915efc4dd9e79e15c6d7cc54cca9be868`

  Now the user will be signed in and he can manage his sessions.
